              Jain Aagams are the sacred scriptures of Jainism – the texts that
              encapsulate the infinite wisdom expounded by Bhagwan Mahavir, the
              24th Tirthankar of Jainism. After attaining kevlagnan or
              omniscience, Bhagwan Mahavir illuminated the world with knowledge
              that transcended the past, present and future, encompassing every
              possible subject of the whole universe. The vast knowledge was
              then assimilated by his disciples, the Gandhars and the Acharyas,
              into Aagam scriptures. During Bhagwan Mahavir’s presence, there
              were countless Aagams. But with time, this legacy of wisdom slowly
              and gradually started depleting. Today, the world has preciously
              conserved 32 of these Aagams as per the Sthankwasi Tradition and
              45 of them as per the Derawasi Tradition.
