                As a young prince, Vardhaman was married to Princess Yashoda and
                had a daughter named Priyadarshana. At the age of thirty, Prince
                Vardhaman abandoned royal life and renounced his home and family
                in the pursuit of spiritual awakening. Even after enjoying
                princely luxuries, his conscience always pricked him about the
                one permanent reality of existence — “Nothing is permanent!
                Neither this body, nor this human birth. Neither relations, nor
                emotions. The only permanent existence is my SOUL.” He had a
                burning desire to shed the layers of ignorance that shroud the
                soul in illusion, to break the shackles of karma, and to attain
                the higher self.

                With an ardent desire to discover the true purpose of life,
                Bhagwan Mahavir renounced worldly life and accepted the vows of
                Diksha in the young age of just 30 years. He immersed himself in
                deep meditation for a period of 12 and a half long years. It is
                said that during this crucial phase, He did not sleep for more
                than 48 minutes, such was His unwavering focus on
                self-attainment. He believed that winning a thousand enemies in
                this world is easy, but conquering the self is the true victory.
                To achieve this, He spent these long years in standing
                meditation, remaining steadfast amidst dangers, fears,
                hardships, and adversities, enduring severe penance of both, the
                body and the mind.

                Bhagwan Mahavir ultimately attained Kevalgnan (omniscience)
                under a Sāla tree on the banks of the River Rujuvalika at the
                age of 42, after years of rigorous sadhana and deep meditation.
                He was not merely an enlightened soul—He was a Tirthankar, a
                divine being who establishes a Tirth (a spiritual ford) to guide
                others across the ocean of worldly existence. This Tirth
                encompasses Sadhus and Sadhvijis (monks and nuns), and Shravaks
                and Shravikas (lay men and women devotees). His first disciples
                were eleven Brahmins, revered as the Gandhars, with Gautam Swami
                as the chief among them. For thirty years after attaining
                omniscience, He journeyed across India, spreading the priceless
                wisdom of truth, non-violence, and inner purity.

                At the age of 72, thirty years after attaining omniscience,
                Bhagwan Mahavir delivered his final discourse at Pawapuri, in
                present-day Bihar, speaking continuously for 48 hours. This
                profound discourse marked the culmination of a life dedicated to
                the upliftment of all souls. On that sacred night, He attained
                Nirvana (liberation from the cycle of birth and death). His
                departure from the mortal world left behind a radiant spiritual
                legacy. Jains commemorate this divine event as Diwali, the
                festival of light, symbolising the eternal brilliance of His
                soul, rooted in deep spiritual awakening.
