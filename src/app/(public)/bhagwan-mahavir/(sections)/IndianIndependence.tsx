            The goal of Bhagwan Mahavir&apos;s principles is to attain spiritual
            peace, secure a better rebirth, and ultimately achieve liberation
            from the cycle of birth and death. It is the path to end sorrow and
            suffering permanently. His timeless teachings not only uplift the

            Inspired by Bhagwan Mahavir’s foremost principle of Ahimsa
            (non-violence), Mahatma Gandhi led India’s independence movement
            through peaceful, bloodless resistance, setting a global example of
            nonviolent transformation. In his footsteps, Nelson Mandela devoted
            his life to liberating South Africa through the same unwavering
            commitment to peace and non-violence. His spirit and ideologies
            continue inspiring the world even today.

            blessed Gandhiji with three infallible vows before he left for
            England – refraining from meat, alcohol and infidelity. Gandhiji
            upheld these vows despite of adversities, which ultimately had a

            independence. Gandhiji highly admired for her visionary thoughts,
