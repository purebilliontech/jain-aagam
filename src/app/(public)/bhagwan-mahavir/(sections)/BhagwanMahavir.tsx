          Bhagwan Mahavir is the 24th Tirthankar of Jainism. Born as Prince
          Vardhaman to a royal family in Kshatriyakund (present-day Bihar), his
          life is a supreme example of the power of the soul to experience its
          full potential. His principles of Ahimsa (nonviolence), satya (truth),
          achaurya (non-stealing), brahmacharya (celibacy) and aparigraha
          (non-possessiveness) are a guiding light for the world even today.
