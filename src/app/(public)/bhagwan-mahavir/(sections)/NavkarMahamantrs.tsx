          Namaskar Mahamantra is a universal Mantra of peace and Maitri (friendship) towards every living being. While most Mantras are dedicated to individuals, Namaskar Mantra is the only mantra that is dedicated to inner qualities.
          <br />
          <br />

          Jainism believes that every soul has the potential to become God and attain absolute purity. Because purity is Godliness. Hence, in Namaskar Mantra, one bows down to every soul who has achieved purity or is striving to achieve purity. Also known as the Navkar Mantra, this is a timeless mantra which has no creator, and no destroyer. Every syllable of this Mantra possesses infinite meanings, potential and energy. Any form of physical illness, mental negativity, critical obstacles can be erased by this selfless mantra, and one can experience a rejuvenation of positivity in life.

          <br /><br />

          The way a child can approach his mother at any hour of the day without hesitation, this mantra can also be recited anytime, anywhere and by anyone - to experience peace, positivity and feel absolutely relaxed.
